Here is a short documentation about the installation process of the GnuCOBOL.
This process is way harder and more annoying than you can imagine and it is mostly due to disparsity of the information on the process and the lack of a good installation guide or document.

1. Install msys64. These are necessary components.
2. Run the below commands to install more required packages including mingw64
```
pacman -Syu
pacman -Su
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
paceman -S development
pacman -S vim
pacman -S nano
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gnucobol
```
3. Then add the binary under c/msys64/mingw64/bin to the PATH variable in environment variables.
4. At this point running the command cobc in terminal should give you an error about the lack of a configuration file. Just go ahead and navigate to c/msys64/mingw64/bin there you will find the file: cobenv.cmd go ahead and edit it like this:
```
setx "COB_LIBRARY_PATH" "%MINGW_ROOT_PATH%lib\gnucobol%COB_LIBRARY_PATH%"
setx "COB_COPY_DIR" "%MINGW_ROOT_PATH%share\gnucobol\copy"
setx "COB_CONFIG_DIR" "%MINGW_ROOT_PATH%share\gnucobol\config"
```
5. execute this file. close the old terminal windows and reopen and try running the compiler. 
``` cobc -x hello.cob ```
